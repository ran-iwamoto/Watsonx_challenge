# IBM Open Source AI

IBM is building enterprise-focused foundation models to drive the future of business. The Granite family of foundation models span a variety of modalities, including language, code, and other modalities, such as time series.

We strongly believe in the power of collaboration and community-driven development to propel AI forward. As such, we will be releasing our latest open innovations on this IBM-Granite GitHub organization page with model weights on our Hugging Face organization. We hope that the AI community will find our efforts useful and that our models help fuel their research.

## Granite models

Granite is IBMâ€™s flagship brand of open large language model (LLM) foundation models spanning multiple modalities. 

### Granite, developed by IBM Research

Granite is IBM's flagship series of LLM foundation models based on decoder-only transformer architecture. Granite language models are trained on trusted enterprise data spanning internet, academic, code, legal and finance. Currently we have four models in the Granite series.

#### Granite for Code

Trained on 116 programming languages, Granite code models (3b, 8b, 20b, 34b ) are optimized for enterprise-grade software development workflows. These models have a range of uses, from simple code completion to complex application modernization tasks and on-device memory constrained use cases.

#### Granite for GeoSpatial

NASA and IBM have teamed up to create an AI Foundation Model for Earth Observations, using large-scale satellite and remote sensing data, including the Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS (link resides outside of ibm.com) data. By embracing the principles of open AI and open science, both organizations are actively contributing to the global mission of promoting knowledge sharing and accelerating innovations in addressing critical environmental challenges.

## Mixtral Model

IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced the availability of the popular open-source Mixtral-8x7B large language model (LLM), developed by Mistral AI, on its watsonx AI and data platform, as it continues to expand capabilities to help clients innovate with IBM's own foundation models and those from a range of open-source providers.
