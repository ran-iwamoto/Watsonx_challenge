# InstructLab

## Basic Background

The mission of the InstructLab (Large-scale Alignment for chatBots) project is to leverage innovative techniques that overcome challenges in Large Language Model (LLM) training. InstructLab uses a taxonomy based curation process, along with synthetic data generation, that allows the open source community to submit contributions to existing LLMs in an accessible way.

Through the InstructLab project, IBM (IBM Research within IBM) and Red Hat have released select open-source licensed Granite language and code models under the Apache 2.0 license. Through subscribing to the commercial license of RHEL AI from Red Hat or by accessing the InstructLab models and toolkit in watsonx.ai, clients can get access to these open-source-licensed Granite language and code models that are also supported and indemnified by Red Hat. For instance, IBM’s granite-7b English language model is now fully integrated into the InstructLab community and accessible directly in watsonx.ai, where developers can contribute new skills and knowledge to collectively enhance these models, just as they would to any other open-source project.

## Taxonomy Explorer

watsonx.ai has also introduced a new interactive visualization called “Taxonomy Explorer” that allows users to explore the knowledge, skills data and taxonomy behind an InstructLab model tuning.
